**[CDPR Hacked, ‘Cyberpunk 2077’ Source Code Held For Ransom](https://www.forbes.com/sites/paultassi/2021/02/09/cdpr-hacked-cyberpunk-2077-source-code-held-for-ransom/)** by Paul Tassi

This Forbes article by senior contributor Paul Tassi describes how hackers have gained access to the source code for Cyberpunk 2077, the Witcher 3, and other files, which are now being held ransom. The hackers threaten to release these files if a deal isn't made, but developer CD Projekt Red refuses to concede.

After an already disastrous launch of Cyberpunk 2077 two months ago, it's highly unfortunate that this should happen to CDPR. I wonder if someone will venture to fix Cyberpunk 2077 now that it is being forcefully made open source?

#### Jordan Zhao's Comment

I wonder how the hackers got the source code, was it on GitHub? And did the account had a very guessable password?
